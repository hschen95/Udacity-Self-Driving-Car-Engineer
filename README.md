# Udacity Self Driving Car Engineer
This repository contains projects completed as part of Udacity's Self-driving Car Engineer Nanodegree.

## Projects

### 1. [Finding Lane Lines](https://github.com/hschen95/Udacity-Self-Driving-Car-Engineer/tree/main/p1-FindingLaneLines)
This project used Python 3, OpenCV, Gaussian smoothing, grayscaling, Canny detection, region of interest, and Hough transofrmation to detect lane lines on the road.
