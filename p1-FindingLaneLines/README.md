![](https://github.com/hschen95/Udacity-Self-Driving-Car-Engineer/blob/main/p1-FindingLaneLines/write_up_images/detectLane.gif)

## Overview
This project creates a pipeline for detecting lane lines on the road.
The pipeline is based on Python, OpenCV, Gaussian smoothing, grayscaling, Canny detection, region of interest, and Hough transofrmation. 



## Environment Setup
1. Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) to set up the environment.
2. Jupyter Notebook
